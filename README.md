GifTastic is a website that uses the Giphy API to show gifs of my favorite 90s TV shows! Click on any button to load up to 10 gifs related to that show. Then click on the gif to see it animated, and click again to make it stop. Have a 90s show you'd like to add? Add it with the "Add a Show" button!
